# Cracked (offline mode) usage
Cracked, officially known as online-mode in Minecraft server.properties is a setting that toggles authenticating with Mojang authentication servers, when disabled, this can also be used to allow cracked players to join the game.

**There is no premium Minecraft. This would imply the existence of a free version, which Mojang does not offer. ALWAYS buy the game and do not use illegal, pirated launchers such as TLauncher.**

## Risks of using cracked
Cracked is deeply insecure and allows for many exploits. It's important to note all of these before deciding to open your server to these risks without the necessary measures. ***Again, we advise against turning cracked on for your server.***

### Username exploiting
When using cracked, accounts are not authenticated by Mojang's servers. This essentially means that account data is solely tied to usernames. This allows people to log in with any username, thus receiving all the data tied to that username. Bought accounts can also be affected by this.
*This can be prevented by installing authentication plugins like LoginSecurity.*

### Bot raids
Not to be confused with DDoS attacks, bot raids are a serious issue on cracked servers lately. A bot raid causes many bots to join your server, likely overloading it and filling up storage with unnecessary player data. You cannot prevent this in cracked servers, just disable cracked and buy the game.

### Punishment bypassing
Since offline mode doesn't check against Mojang authentication servers, players can change their username, so for instance, if a player gets non-ip banned, they can just change their username and join again, even if you IP ban, they can use a VPN or reset their router (assuming they have a dynamic IP which most people do) to get a new IP, the first can be prevented with an anti-VPN plugin, the second isn't possible.

## But I have no money!
Get a job, even if you aren't of the age to get a job, you can mow someone's lawn, shovel snow, etc, or ask your parents to buy you Minecraft as a birthday or Christmas gift. This is not an excuse to pirate Minecraft or any game for that matter. While pirating won't get you arrested, it remains illegal. 

# Legitimate uses for offline mode
Sometimes, there are genuine use cases, but they still suffer from the problems above, here are some legitimate uses for offline mode:
- Authentication servers are dead for your version (<1.7.10 for example)
- You live and host your server in Siberia and have no connection to Mojang
- The authentication servers are almost offline all the time
- You're hosting a LAN game with no internet access

But honestly, these are all very rare cases, and you should just buy the game.
