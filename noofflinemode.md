# Why not to use offline mode
Some people think that offline mode is a good idea, but it's not. Offline mode has many issues and is not recommended. Here are some of the issues:
- Offline mode can be used to bypass bans, even IP bans if they have a VPN or just use a different IP (Most IPs are dynamic, so they can simply reboot their router to get a new IP) since they can just join with a different username.
- Can cause DDoS (sort of) attacks where bots join and leave your server really, *really* fast to cause lag and make your server unplayable.
- Can be used to bypass the whitelist, since they can just join with a different username as someone that is whitelisted.
- Can be used to gain OP as they can log in as someone that has OP (If anyone has OP)

# Login plugins
Login plugins are a good way to prevent some issues but don't fix a lot of them, and some can be completely bypassed(!!!)

# Anti-VPN plugins
Anti-VPN plugins can fix quite a lot of issues with offline mode, but they can also cause issues. They can cause issues because they can block some legitimate players, and they can also cause issues because they can block some VPNs that are used for legitimate reasons, such as to bypass a firewall or to bypass a country's internet restrictions, and rebooting your router to get a new IP completely bypasses this.

# Conclusion
Offline mode is not recommended, and you should use a login plugin, and an anti-VPN plugin if you want to use offline mode, but you should just use online mode.
There are lots of ways to make money if you can't afford the game, even if you can't get a job, mow someone's grass, shovel snow, or even just ask your parents for money, piracy is not the solution.
